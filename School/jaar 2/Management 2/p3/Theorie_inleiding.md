### Waterfall: PMI & Prince 2

- PMBOK
    - Project Management Body of Knowledge
    - A project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end time, and therefore defined scope and resources.
    - And a project is unique in that it is not a routine operation, but a specific set of operations designed to accomplish a singular goal.

- Prince 2
    - Projects In Controlled Encironments
    - Project is defined as "a temporary organization that is created for the purpose of deflivering one or more business products according to an agreed Business Case"

- *Unique*: It is never done before
- *Temporary nature*: A project always has an end
- *Uncertainty*: All projects are being planned before they are executed, this implies risk
- *Complecity*: Relations between tasks could be cery complex, projects require different disciplines in many cases.
- *The objective*: A project has a goal or end-product.
- *Life cycle*: A project is planned and has a structure of execution.
- *Executive or client*: Commits to the end-result of the project.

    - Customer keeps adding requirements which add to the total time and cost.
