To make your qBittorrent container use the `wg0` WireGuard interface, you need to ensure that all the traffic from the container is routed through the `wg0` interface. This involves setting up policy-based routing and ensuring that Docker uses the appropriate network settings. Below are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Configure Policy-Based Routing

1. **Identify the `wg0` interface:**
   Ensure that the `wg0` interface is up and running.
   ```sh
   ip addr show wg0
   ```

2. **Find the `wg0` gateway:**
   Determine the gateway for the `wg0` interface.
   ```sh
   ip route show default dev wg0
   ```

3. **Add a routing table:**
   Add a new routing table entry in `/etc/iproute2/rt_tables`.
   ```sh
   echo "200 wg0" | sudo tee -a /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
   ```

4. **Create a rule to route traffic:**
   Add a rule to route traffic from a specific subnet through the `wg0` interface.
   ```sh
   sudo ip rule add from 172.20.0.0/16 table wg0
   sudo ip route add default dev wg0 table wg0
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Docker Network

1. **Create a custom Docker network:**
   Create a Docker network that uses the subnet from which traffic will be routed through the `wg0` interface.
   ```sh
   docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 wg0-network
   ```

2. **Run the qBittorrent container on this network:**
   Ensure that the container uses the custom network.
   ```sh
   docker run -d \
     --name qbittorrent \
     --network wg0-network \
     --ip 172.18.0.2 \
     -e WEBUI_PORT=8080 \
     -v /path/to/qbittorrent/config:/config \
     -v /path/to/qbittorrent/downloads:/downloads \
     linuxserver/qbittorrent
   ```

### Step 3: Verify the Configuration

1. **Check the container's IP:**
   Ensure that the container is using the IP address from the custom network.
   ```sh
   docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' qbittorrent
   ```

2. **Test the routing:**
   Verify that the traffic from the qBittorrent container is routed through the `wg0` interface.
   ```sh
   docker exec qbittorrent curl ifconfig.me
   ```
   This should return the IP address of the `wg0` interface.

### Additional Notes

- **Persisting the Configuration:**
  Ensure that the routing rules persist across reboots by adding the necessary commands to a startup script or using a tool like `netplan` or `systemd`.

- **Adjusting the Firewall:**
  If you have firewall rules, ensure they allow traffic from the `wg0` interface and the Docker container.

By following these steps, your qBittorrent container should route all its traffic through the `wg0` WireGuard interface, ensuring that it uses the VPN tunnel for all its network communication.
